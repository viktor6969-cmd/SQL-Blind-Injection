# SQL-Blind-Injection
Blind SQLi brutforce injector

I am currently learning about SQL injections, and as part of practicing labs and CTF challenges, I often need to perform blind SQLi brute-force attacks. While tools like Burp Suite or similar applications can handle this, the community edition of Burp Suite is intentionally throttled, making it quite slow. To address this, I created my own custom Python script. Although Python is not the fastest language, my script is significantly faster than the slowed-down Burp Suite version.

I plan to add new features such as binary search for quicker execution, a function to determine password lengths, and other enhancements to improve its efficiency and functionality.
